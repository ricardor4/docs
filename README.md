# Soroswap.Finance
Open-source AMM protocol for providing liquidity and trading Stellar Assets in Soroban. With SDK and easy to use frontend.

The Soroswap Protocol is committed to contributing to the Soroban ecosystem by providing 100% open-source smart contract protocols and libraries that any project can use as building blocks. 

Our goal is to create a user-friendly front-end with tested and working smart contracts that implement UniswapV2, with future plans to incorporate UniswapV3 features to reduce impermanent loss.
